Hi, I’m @sdg1309.

Hello there
Hi! I'm SDG1309, a 21-year-old Physics student at the Escuela de Ingeniería de Antioquia (EIA).

I enjoy exploring the universe from both the physical and computational perspectives. My interests span from programming and scientific computing to astrophysics and particle physics, which I’m gradually diving deeper into.

I started programming a few years ago, mainly for academic projects and personal experiments in physics, and I’ve been growing my toolkit ever since.
